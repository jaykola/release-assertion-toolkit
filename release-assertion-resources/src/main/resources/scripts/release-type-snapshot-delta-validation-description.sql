	Assertion:
	The current data in the Description snapshot file are the same as the data 
	in the current delta file.

	The current full file is the same as the prior version of the same full 
	file, except for the delta rows. Therefore, when the delta rows are excluded 
	from the current file, it should be identical to the prior version.

	This test identifies rows in prior, not in current, and in current, not in 
	prior.
